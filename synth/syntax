Synth language syntax:


Start a new synth definition with

    newsynth <name>
    
New generators will now be added to this synth.


Add new generator and set current generator with

    g <type> <name>

Set the current generator to an existing one (for modification) with

    m <name>
    
Set parameters in current generator with

    p <param> <val>, <param> <val>, ... ;

Set current generator do be a "done monitor" with 

    done

When all done monitors have completed, the sound is finished. Only
envelope generators currently have completion semantics.

Set the current generator to be the audio output with

    out
    




Add links with

<outname> -> <inname>:<inportname>

Play notes with

+ <freq>,<freq>,...;

    

An example:

newsynth wibble 
g sin sosc1 out
p amp 0.1, freq 400;

g env myenv 
p l0 0, t0 0, l1 1, t1 0.1, t2 1, l2 0;
myenv->sosc1:amp
+ 400,420,330;
