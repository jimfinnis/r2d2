# create an env generator called env1, and make it a "done monitor" - the
# sound is finished when all donemons are complete.
# Envs use a special syntax without the "g" keyword, but their params
# can still be modified with "p" etc. Note that "done" is a separate command,
# which makes the current generator a donemon.
#
# We need to be careful with the order in which gens are created: put
# those gens which are earlier in the directed graph which forms the
# synth patch first. Here, the envelope generator feeds into the 
# oscillator (modulating its amp), so we add it before the oscillator.

# create a sin osc called sin2 with a freq mult of 1.01. The "p" keyword
# sets parameters in the current synth, which are key-value pairs
# separated by commas and terminated with a semicolon: "k1 v1, k2 v2;".
# There's only one here, and it's the last thing on the line so we
# don't need the terminator (that's only necessary if we have another
# command on the same line).
