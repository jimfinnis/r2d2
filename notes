OK, here's how it should work. The little beastie should have hormones
for each "emotion", and these should be primordial. Most of them are
negative.

In this simple case we make the following assumptions:
1) the robot has an ongoing task (data collection, hoovering, whatever)
2) the robot needs to charge ("hunger")
[3) the robot has some kind of map, which is more accurate in some areas
than others, and knows how accurate the map is in its locality]
4) the robot has noxious stimuli, perhaps of two kinds - gradual
unpleasantness and sudden shocks.

FEAR: noxious stimuli detected. Released slowly, decays slowly
[UNCERTAINTY (UNC): in an unmapped area - release moderate, decay moderate]
PAIN: release rapid, decay rapid
HUNGER: release slowly, decay rapid (comes from batt charge)
HAPPY: doing the required job well. Release slowly, decay moderate
BURBLE: constantly released very slowly, decays slowly

Painful stimuli also release FEAR.

These hormones cascade - singly and directly - into corresponding
"sound urge" hormones.

The robot constantly checks the hormone levels, and if the highest level
hormone is above a threshold it plays an appropriate sound and reduces
that sound hormone level by some large percentage - leaving the actual
primary hormone untouched. The intuition here is that the urge to make
a sound is secondary to and triggered by the underlying neurochemical state,
and that succumbing to the urge relieves it without modifying the underlying
state.


Then all we do is have two threads. Thread 1 is performing the main code,
updating the robot and doing what it needs to do, and updating the above
levels. Thread 2 is a monophonic synth, doing the following:

while true:
    delay for very short while (~0.1s)
    S = lock, fetch hormone set, unlock
    [h,c] = maximum hormone in set and its concentration
    if c>threshold:
        play sound for hormone h (blocking)
        lock, reduce hormone h, unlock


Extensions:

Some extras are combinations of the above using Zadeh's operators,
treating the emotions as if they were fuzzy logic:

Contentment: happy and very not hungry
Bored: not happy and not hungry?
Trepidation: a bit fearful and uncertain
Brave: fearful and happy
